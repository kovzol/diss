\begin_layout Standard
There are plenty of available frameworks to study Euclidean geometry at
 secondary school level.
 But in most textbooks some simplifications are used to hide the axiomatic
 difficulties.
 Thus, in most frameworks some basic theorems are accepted without further
 explanations since they are

 It is no longer used in the Hungarian education system, but its structure
 for stating and proving theorems is still remarkable.
 This textbook consists of 33 topics to cover the most important parts of
 mathematics for a 14 years old student.

\begin_layout Subsection
GeoGebra files and applets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we discuss which theorems of the given framework could be
 verified or proved by the Relation Tool in GeoGebra.
 Here we emphasize again that this should be only one step in the teaching
 process, and it should be followed by further observation as described
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:Proofs-in-education"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:De-Villiers'-model"

\end_inset

.
 Also in many cases the Relation Tool is not the best or the only way to
 collect information about geometric facts.
 Nevertheless, GeoGebra already has support for such investigations, so
 it can be fruitful to demonstrate some of the statements with the Relation
 Tool as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For some theorems it is clear that it would be technically easier to use
 the 
\series bold
Prove
\series default
 or 
\series bold
ProveDetails
\series default
 commands directly, mostly in those which contain algebraic expressions.
 But in this section we avoid using any command line input to focus on point-and
-click capabilities of GeoGebra instead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Triangles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We mentioned in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:Implementation-in-GeoGebra"

\end_inset

 that our current technological possibilities are limited to deal with equations
 only.
 Thus Theorem 1 cannot be observed by the Relation Tool at the moment, either.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a better case with Theorems 2 and 3.
 In Theorem 2 we have to show that a sum of two expressions (or areas) of
 squares equals to another square.
 Before constructing triange 
\begin_inset Formula $ABC$
\end_inset

 we need to constraint for example point 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 to lie on the line 
\begin_inset Formula $b'$
\end_inset

 (which lies on 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and perpendicular to 
\begin_inset Formula $AB$
\end_inset

) to ensure that 
\begin_inset Formula $ABC\triangle$
\end_inset

 is right.
 Now we can define squares 1, 2 and 3 by using the Regular Polygon Tool
 in GeoGebra.
 To compare their areas we need to create the sum of objects 
\emph on
square1
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
square2
\emph default
 as a number object, namely 
\emph on
sum
\emph default
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Mat1-Th2"

\end_inset

).
 Now 
\emph on
square3
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
sum
\emph default
 can be compared by the Relation Tool 
\emph on
numerically
\emph default
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Mat1-Th2-1"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Mat1-Th2-0"

\end_inset

).
 In this case, unfortunately, GeoGebra cannot compute the answer 
\emph on
symbolically
\emph default
, so we need to be satisfied with the numerical result for now.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The problem is the lack of support for handling a regular polygon in the
 prover backends yet.
 Since the Area method is capable of computing the proof for Theorem 2,
 it is feasible to expect improvements on this issue for future version
 of GeoGebra.

Since proofs for measuring angles are not supported in GeoGebra, either,
 it is not yet possible to checking Theorem 4 symbolically.
 However, the way how the Relation Tool could be invoked is similar as done
 in the previous theorems: we create number object

sum1
\emph default
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha+\beta+\gamma$
\end_inset

 and 
\emph on
sum2

 as

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 are intentional extra angles to describe straight angle (

).

This seems rather inconvenient and one could expect support for handling

 directly.
 On the other hand, some proofs of this theorem emphasize the importance
 of straight angle is in fact sum of two right angles.

To construct a parallelogram, thus we may need 6 different ways to sketch
 the drawing up with GeoGebra.
 Also 6 different methods are required to read the relations off by using
 the Relation Tool.
 In this section for demonstration we investigate the case when statement
 1 holds and check whether statements 2, 5 and 6 can be concluded.

\begin_inset Formula $a\parallel b$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c\parallel d$
\end_inset

 We use notations 
\begin_inset Formula $g=AB,\, h=CD,\, E=AC\cap BD,\, i=AE,\, j=CE$
\end_inset

.
 Also angles at vertices are marked as shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Now we can simply compare the angles 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 and

 Also we can compare 
\begin_inset Formula $g$

\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

: they will always be parallel and under the condition 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Various lines and circles of a triangle

\begin_layout Standard
The easiest way for Theorem 14 to be formalized in GeoGebra is to draw triangle
 
\begin_inset Formula $ABC$
\end_inset

 and create its perpendicular bisectors 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

, then enter command

.
 There is no such an easy way from the Relation Tool approach to check concurren
cy of three lines since only two objects can be selected by the mouse pointer
 at the moment.
 On the other hand, it is possible to define two of the bisectors (say 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

) and take the intersection point 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 of them, and then check if this point lies on the third bisector (i.

\begin_inset Formula $f$

 6 of the theorems could not be verified by the Relation Tool because of

 Otherwise all other theorems could be checked at least numerically.
 10 theorems could be proven by GeoGebra symbolically, 9 of them were properly
 formulated by providing a sufficient condition as well if needed.

Cinderella.
 This means that if a new object is constructed which is theoretically the
 same as a formerly defined object, then the new object will not be added
 to the list of objects, but the first object will be used.
 From the educational point of view this is, however, not always recommendable.
 Sometimes the teacher wants to emphasize that two objects are maybe the
 same, maybe not, and waits for the students' interaction for the answer
 to be uncovered.

(CAA) systems.
 That is, a proving subsystem of a CAA could enable a quick evaluation whether
 the student created a solution that is different from the one provided
 by the teacher, but is still mathematically equivalent to it.
 At the moment there are on-going developments of the GeoGebra software
 tool exactly into this direction, lead by 
\emph on
Christoph Stadlbauer
\emph default
 in Linz, Austria, in the frame of his master thesis, advised by Markus
 Hohenwarter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The CAA/ATP concept can be explained by an example.
 The teacher asks the student to create a right triangle by using GeoGebra.
 When the teacher designs this question, she could be thinking of one correct
 construction, where the third vertex is the output and it depends on the
 first two vertices as inputs, by using Euclidean steps only (i.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

e., only a compass and a ruler).
 During the test time the teacher's construction steps will be hidden for
 the student, but the built-in ATP system will check if the output vertex
 of the student coincides with the one of the teacher's template---even
 if the student intermediate steps are different form those of the teacher.
 Here GeoGebra could give a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sure” yes/no answer, and the computer would be able to decide whether the
 student has solved the problem correctly or not.
 Of course, in a number cases the symbolical method will simply fail because
 of unsupported statements.
 In such cases some numerical checks can be used for fallback.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can also think of open ended tests where finding the intermediate steps
 can also be crucial.
 For example, given a circle 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 with its center 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

 and an external point 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

, the student's task is to construct a tangent line 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

.
 The teacher knows that the basic idea for the usual solution is to create
 the midpoint 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $OP$
\end_inset

.
 It helps drawing a second circle 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 with center 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 aligning on both 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

, and now the intersection points of 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 will define the tangent points (because of Thales' circle theorem
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
theorem!--, Thales'
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 Here finding the importance of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is already an intellectual challenge and thus the teacher may highlight
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

important intermediate points
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in his/her template, not only the possible final results 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 In case the student finds 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 by constructing it somehow GeoGebra could encourage the student by telling
 he/she is working in the good direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After some further enhancements on GeoGebra we could think of it to be an
 expert system in Euclidean geometry: the ATP features could be used in
 the background, in some sense 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

in advance
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 before the user interactions.
 For example, when a construction is given, GeoGebra could also automatically
 identify certain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

interesting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 properties on the construction.
 For instance, when the circumcenter, the centroid and the orthocenter of
 a triangle have already been constructed, GeoGebra could 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

know
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that these points are collinear and provide this information to the user
 when asked.
 Such an “auto-relation” feature could extend the already existing Relation
 Tool.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another direction for further improvements is to give a counterexample when
 the checked statement is not always true.

\begin_layout Standard
We have not yet mentioned the obvious direction of enhancements for 3 dimensiona
l constructions.
 The 3D modeling support in GeoGebra 5 is already in mature state, thus
 a natural improvement of the theorem prover subsystem is to allow computing
 proofs for 3D constructions.
 Unfortunately, the computational demand to prove 3D theorems seems to be
 challenging due to the increased number of variables in the algebraic approach
 (which is, roughly 50% more than for the 2D case), but anyway: such improvement
s in the source code would be quite straightforward.
 For some basic tests and discussions concerning 3D geometry provers we
 refer to

\begin_layout Standard
Ultimately, we discuss the question of expecting a dramatical change of
 the idea of mathematical reasoning from the teacher's perspective as well
 in the long term.
 Proof is traditionally considered as a human act which requires intellectual
 work.
 But to utilize a computer to obtain the conclusion is actually something
 purely mechanical.
 This may change the teacher's role fundamentally, raising him/her to a
 higher level in the education process---at least this could be expected
 as a major change when ATP/ADG facility in DGS will be widely used in schools.
