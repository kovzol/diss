\begin_layout Standard
This chapter deals with the topic mathematics and proofs from an educational
 perspective.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the first part of the chapter a short overview is shown about the main
 trends in proofs in mathematics education in the twentieth century, and
 influence of computers is discussed.
 Then the teacher's role is in focus.
 The main point of the section is to analyze the role of the Euclidean geometry
 in conjecturing and proving, which are empowered nowadays by utilizing
 computer software as well.
 Since computers are already able to prove geometry theorems automatically,
 it is a natural question whether we are ready to support computer aided
 proof teaching as well.
 Finally, de Villiers' concept on teaching of proofs is discussed by focusing
 on possible ways to utilize a computer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second part of this chapter demonstrates the recent situation of computer
 based proving in mathematics education.
 Several pieces of computer software are reviewed concerning their strengths
 and weaknesses.

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

) to be the most faithful description how the process of understanding works
 among mathematicians.
 This is why it is questionable that in reflection of practice DTP can be
 the best approach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Until the 1950's, however, DTP was the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

necessary evil
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in mathematics education, but playing a role mostly in geometry classes
 where proofs were introduced.
 But instead of being a source of deeper mathematical understanding, proofs
 were rather a ritual by simply memorising classical proofs.
 This could be one of the reasons why curriculum reforms in the 1960's moved
 towards the direction to not use proofs at all, also by abandoning DTP.
 One of these trends is the 
\emph on
back-to-basics movement

 real understanding of what was learned (

 This confirms influence of computers indeed resulted in a radical shift

 Despite the initial disagreements and discussions of the validity of these

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But there are still doubts, and criticism comes often from mathematicians.
 For instance, the 
\emph on
Kepler conjecture
\emph default
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

) about sphere packing in the three dimensional Euclidean space, was already
 justified by 
\emph on
Hales
\emph default
 in 1998 with a proof by exhaustion involving the checking of many individual
 cases using complex computer calculations.
 Unfortunately, Hales' proof was not fully accepted by the referees who
 were just 
\emph on
almost
\emph default
 certain of the correctness of the proof.
 Recently, after several years of related work, in 2014 Hales and his 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

In Hales' case the proof uses 
\emph on
exhaustion
\emph default
 which means that a computer (or a set of computers, or a 
\emph on

\emph default
 as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "rubik"

\end_inset

 which required 35 CPU-years of idle computer time) verifies a finite (but
 very large) number of calculations.
 Thus human verification of the proof cannot be working by checking each
 calculation manually, which actually means that Hales' proof is not yet
 widely accepted by the community, despite of the facts that Hales and his
 team with more than 20 members fully documented each step of the proof,
 used a verified C compiler, and a verified operating system.
 (The verification of the whole proof took about 5000 CPU-hours, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 for details.)

Geometric Theorem

 to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Geometric Proof
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, geometric proofs can be achieved by translating the geometric theorem
 to an algebraic problem, proving it (algebraically), and then accept the
 algebraic proof instead of the geometric one.
 This 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

workaround
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 is required because the classic axiomatic way---and also artificial intelligenc

 automatized, as Beeson emphasizes,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
\begin_inset Formula $\ldots$
\end_inset

we still do not have machine-found or even machine-checkable geometric proofs
 of the theorems in Euclid Book I, from a suitable set of first-order axioms---l
et alone the more complicated theorems that have been verified by computerized
 algebraic computations.

An algebraic proof can be computationally slow even for a machine and unreadably
 long and complicated for a human, also the algebraic steps usually hide
 the geometric meaning (see an example

 Proving inequalities may be computationally even slower.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The algebraic proof sometimes requires some extra conditions to be correct,
 which may not be translatable to straightforward geometric content (see

In both variants Step 2 is computationally heavy for many elementary Euclidean
 geometry theorems.
 In fact, Step 2 is computed by calculating the Gröbner basis of a set of
 multivariate polynomials which is a general method not only for geometry
 theorem proving but to solve a wide range of other mathematical problems.
 When computing a Gröbner basis of a set much more extra information is
 yielded than for Wu's method, thus this technique is theoretically much
 slower for the general case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, effective computation of a Gröbner basis has a huge literatur

 like Wu's method is, and has some different advantages and extra features.
 What is more, in classroom situations it usually overperforms the other
 methods.
 Thus in this thesis the focus is on finding acceptable implementations

The axiomatic way
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned above, the pure axiomatic way for proving Euclidean theorems
 is much harder to be automatized than using any of the already listed methods.
 One of the main difficulties is to turn visually obvious facts into precise
 axiomatic statements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are more axiomatic systems which can be used to define plane geometry.
 The most well known are Hilbert's system (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "hilbert"

\end_inset

, containing 20 axioms) and Tarski's geometry (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Tarski1983"

\end_inset

, with 10 axioms).
 Both systems have already been used to axiomatically prove the most well
 known Euclidean theorems, both manually and in an automatized way.
 However, the (semi-)automatized process of the Euclidean theorems has just
 recently been started by Narboux and his colleagues (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Tarski's system

 is investigated in details in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Here it is important to emphasize that 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Tarski's system has the unusual property that all sentences can be written
 in universal-existential form
\begin_inset Formula $\ldots$
\end_inset

 This form has all universal quantifiers preceding any existential quantifiers,
 so that all sentences can be recast in the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\forall u\forall v\ldots\exists a\exists b\dots$
\end_inset

 This fact allowed Tarski to prove that Euclidean geometry is decidable:
 there exists an algorithm which can determine the truth or falsity of any
 sentence.
 Tarski's axiomatization is also complete.

 Maybe this is too much for a future dream
\begin_inset Formula $\ldots$
\end_inset

 But it is, anyhow, a promising research, in our opinion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recio and Vélez here used the Gröbner basis method for the algebraic computation
s.
 15 years after Recio's and Vélez's publication (and more than 25 years
 after Chou's revolutionary book) the speed of computers increased so much
 that a typical personal computer can produce proofs for most Euclidean
 theorems in reasonable time.
 Thus speed seems not an issue anymore---the algorithms in the background
 use heavy computations which may yield thousands of derivation steps being
 generated within a second.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The detailed output of the algebraic geometry method is, however, not really
 useful for the educational approach.
 This method turns the geometric figure into equations first, then the equations
 must be solved by a long derivation.
 It is not unusual that the steps fill hundreds of pages (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:Readability-of-algebraic"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Desargues'-theorem-with"

\end_inset

 for a 23 pages long derivation for Desargues's theorem).
 Since the derivation is purely algebraic, it tells nothing practical about
 the reason why the geometric theorem is true.
 It does not help 
\emph on
understanding
\emph default
 at all, only supports an extra step in the verification whether the statement
 is true or false.
 For the same reason, teaching of 
\emph on
argumentation
\emph default
 is not supported by the algebraic geometry method, either.
 As an immediate conclusion, one may consider the algebraic method as an
 effective way for getting a yes/no answer
\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 to check the truth of a statement, but not for getting the derivation for

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of the other ATP methods focus much more on reasoning, but most of
 them are not directly applicable in the classroom, either.
 Probably the most fruitful approach is to lay down a suitable axiomatic
 system specially prepared for secondary school use.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Coq
\end_layout

\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Coq:manual"

\end_inset

).
 In the Coq system a rigorous formal argumentation is required to prove
 theorems, and like in real life, a set of predefined definitions and lemmas
 are already available.
 The teacher is able to fine-tune existing frameworks to define the appropriate
 theory which covers the classroom topics, or even to create a new framework.
 It is also possible to do minor changes for the individual classroom, thus
 teaching with Coq (or a similar axiomaic system) is in some sense a faithful
 reflection of mathematical practice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is, however, still far from being convenient enough and hence it is
 not very practical yet.
 Coq is definitely a formal system, and all attempts already made to convert
 Euclidean geometry into a formal logic system lose significant properties
 of the Euclidean paradigm.
 There is a large intellectual bridge needed to turn not rigorous but visually
 obvious argumentation steps into rigorous formal steps, and as such, this
 cannot be expected neither from the student, nor from the teacher.
 From the educational perspective, Coq can still be a useful system for
 teaching argumentation, but---according to the opinion of the author of
 this thesis---not for Euclidean geometry yet.
 Instead, teaching 
\emph on
formal logic
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
abstract algebra
\emph default
 in such a way seems to be a much better fitting scenario.
 The web page

\end_inset


\family default
 collects some related attempts to bring Coq into the classroom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another issue with axiomatic based reasoning is speed.
 Without a help of a human, Coq can still compute the validity of a statement
 whether it can be proven or (otherwise) it can be denied.
 But the processing time for this computation is still out of bounds from
 the approach to be feasible for classroom use.
 That is, Coq (or being more general, the formal logic method itself) can
 also compute a yes/no answer (like the algebraic geometry method), but
 it is much slower.
 (See 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Coq"

\end_inset

 for more details.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That is, in praxis the algebraic geometry method is still more useful, although
 it can be used only for getting a yes/no answer about the truth of a given
 statement.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:Implementation-in-GeoGebra"

\end_inset

 one may see that there is an extra benefit for using the algebraic geometry
 method, namely that one can get some extra conditions 
\emph on
when exactly
\emph default
 the statement is true.
 In other words, a student may ask a question in a DGS if the given property
 is true in his or her construction, for example if three given lines are
 always concurrent (since he or she already checked a number of cases visually).
 In this case the ATP subsystem may answer

Ideally for the classroom use, a proving method should be able to change
 granularity on demand, and to hide some unwanted details without losing
 the essence of the proof.
 For most proving methods it is a common problem that the proof may consist
 of too many steps.
 Even if each step can be understood at elementary or secondary level, the
 high number of steps makes the output not useful in the education.
 Thus it would be desirable to combine atomic steps to

) which is a clear summary of deciding when to study a proof (or in general,
 a subarea of mathematics) in all details.
 When starting to study a subarea the student should learn some 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

specific insights and techniques
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, even if they seem to be a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

torture
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

---here Buchberger's example is teaching integral rules at the introductory
 level.
 But later, when the subarea is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

thoroughly understood
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, many of the used techniques become trivial to the student, and it is better
 to free the mind for creative activity---here Buchberger's example is to
 use a 
\emph on
computer algebra system
\emph default
 (CAS)
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature

\end_inset

 instead.
 In such cases some atomic steps can be combined and the atomic content
 can be fully considered as a black box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However Buchberger himself mentions geometrical theorem proving as a possible
 subarea for blackboxing (in particular Wu's method and the Gröbner basis
 method are listed), white box study of the atomic steps seem to be problematic
 from the mass education approach.
 For the algebraic methods one reason is the high number of atomic steps
 which cannot be grouped into smaller amount of black boxes, and cannot
 be connected with a visible geometrical meaning.
 For the area and the full angle methods the atomic steps are easy, but
 there are sometimes too many of them, and it is too difficult to consider
 a grouped collection of them as a separated item.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, both the area and the full angle methods (and also the
 recently introduced mass point method) require additional definitions which
 may be beyond the secondary level, and their output differ from traditional
 textbook proofs.
 Thus, at least from the classroom perspective, much more attention is given
 to the
\emph on
 
\emph default
GDD method.
 This approach is not so effective as the above ones (both in speed and
 the applicable set of inputs, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "visual2"

\end_inset

), but it indeed produces traditional readable proofs.
 This method seems to be a good candidate to be a tool in the long term
 to support argumentation, however, it is still subject of perfecting at
 the moment and its full step-by-step algorithm is not published yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In fact the GDD method is some kind of imitation of human thinking.
 Here it must emphasized that it is not straightforward how a computer based
 tool can mimic the traditional way of teaching proofs.
 The Chinese ADG experts made great efforts to bring the human intelligence
 into a computer software as much as it is technically possible.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 remark, when pointing out the importance of intelligence and heuristics
 to create an automatic visual proof with the GDD method:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
In our opinion, human traditional proofs of geometry theorems require enormous
 amounts of human intelligence.
 Even more intelligence is required for adding auxiliary elements

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Auxiliary elements are such new non-trivial objects added to the construction
 which help in continuing the proof.
 One can call them

 as well.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Thus heuristics for adding auxiliary elements are necessary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 acknowledge that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

the success in using the traditional methods for automated proving geometry
 theorems is very limited

.
 Only a relatively small set of theorems can be proven in such a way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In sum it is in fact impossible to select the best one of the available
 proving methods for the whole Euclidean geometry---all methods have their
 strengths and weaknesses:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Algebraic methods are fast, but do not produce readable proofs.

Although the GEX tool is still rather a research software than an educational
 application for direct classroom use, it is important to highlight its
 GDD method as a possible step forward to teach argumentation in secondary
 schools.

\emph on

 which may be satisfactory already with the current achievements since just
 a very limited set of the Euclidean geometry can be discussed on secondary
 level.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is also needed to discuss if the newly available technology is helpful
 in promoting the teaching of proofs at all.
 Despite the technical opportunities, the teacher may still stop using computers
 if technology cannot add enough extra features to the traditional teaching
 methods.
 Ye et al.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

emphasize that their 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

goal [was] to make it easier for the user to read the proof of a geometry
 theorem with various dynamic visual effects that the computer display and
 the mouse can offer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 But in fact in the classroom the teacher can do similar steps on the blackboard
 as well by continuously changing the figure with the chalk and the sponge.
 What is more, personal communication with the teacher during the proof
 may be desirable for more students than to use the computer individually
 but impersonally.
 Here it is emphasized that 
\emph on
the ADG supply
\emph default
 is just one side of the coin, the other side is 
\emph on
the educational demand
\emph default
 (see our final diagram on the gap between those in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:The-gap-between"

\end_inset

).
 That is, the teacher's presentation (including the students' immediate
 feedback as part of the presentation), like an interactive theater play,
 is probably onefold and unrepeatable, however, the computer can also explain
 the details interactively over and over again.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RecioVelez99"

\end_inset

 implicitly assumed the importance of teaching Euclidean geometry in the
 modern era, it is still not straightforward how exactly it could be supported
 by utilizing computers.
 In the time of writing their publication the success story of DGS was just
 at its beginning.
 There might be other disciplines of mathematics (like e.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

algebraic derivations, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

) which fit teaching proofs much better than geometry when computers are
 used.
 On the other hand, experimenting with geometry objects seems a natural
 way to start thinking about mathematics when utilizing a computer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It seems that Euclidean geometry has been living its renaissance in the
 classroom in the recent years, probably because of success of DGS tools.
 But the link is still missing between conjecture and proof, specifically
 between DGS and ATP.
 In this section a list of the technical barriers was made.
 However, to fill the gap, the question is usually not really technical
 anymore, but educational.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following

 the preliminary preparation of an applicable empirical theory and an appropriat

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

introduction, prerequisites
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 This step may require much more time and experience than one can expect
 since an approximate plan (a syllabus) is required to organize the theory
 into smaller sections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When using a proof assistant software (like Coq
\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

) the teacher needs to create these sections in advance: these sections
 will be called a 
\series bold
per theory framework
\series default
 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Possible-ways-for"

\end_inset

) in this chapter.
 A per theory framework reflects the mathematical practice well, and allows
 to explore the theory in smaller amount of theories which are easier to
 understand.
 In other words, students may require a certain amount of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rest time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 between 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

doses
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset space ~

during the next class all the previously communicated information is assumed
 to be known.
 This construction strategy should be kept in mind when a computer software
 is planned to be used in the classroom.
 A research study on such a framework is

Technically, Step 1 (

 more difficult.
 First of all, it can be challenging to estimate the required time on the
 student's side to make enough experiments---too many or too few can also
 be a problem.
 Since it usually takes much more time to create a quality DGS material

 appropriate

Erdős's child prodigy student

 emphasizes the importance of secret keeping.
 Since 1988 he has been organizing his own weekend maths camps with several
 groups of 20--35 students.
 In a camp, students mostly work in groups of 2--4, but there are also plenary
 sessions where they discuss solutions (

 The basic (and strictly adhered) rule in his camps that a solution cannot

A DGS can give support to check not only one single occurence of a mathematical

 When the so-called 
\emph on

 are dragged by the student in the construction, all dependent objects are
 recomputed and redrawn.
 Hence the student can visually verify the truth of the statement by checking
 many 
\series bold
different positions
\series default
 of the appropriate objects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The student may ask for 
\series bold
extra verification
\series default
 from the DGS.
 For example, a green light icon may be shown when the statement is true
 for the inputs, and a red light icon in the opposite case.
 The student only has to concentrate on watching the colors while he or
 she drags the free objects randomly.
 This idea can be further developed to create a

 for a detailed comparison).
 Anyway, Level 6 makes a fundamental difference, and as such, it can be
 identified as the startpoint of the long awaited link between DGS and ATP.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One could recall 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Stylianides12"

\end_inset

's remark about the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

robust misconception
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of many students that conjectures are proofs in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Teaching-Euclidean-proofs:"

\end_inset

 (see page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "increased-availability-in"

\end_inset

).
 This lays the foundation of the importance for supporting Level 6 verifications
, but a DGS should draw attention to the philosophical difference.
 A positive result for a Level 5 or lower verification can never be the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sure event
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 since all (infinitely many) tests cannot be computed.
 An essential property of mathematics that by using some other ways than
 testing, one can indeed have an overview of 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 cases, and this different way is 
\emph on
proving
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It has to be emphasized that mathematics differs from other sciences in
 this sense.
 Physics, for example, can never be sure that the law of gravity will be
 valid forever.
 Of course, the 
\emph on
idea
\emph default
 of gravity (with mathematics in the background) can be everlasting (actually,
 it 
\emph on
is
\emph default
).
 Other sciences suffer from the same problem.
 Although each science has its role and importance, the strength of mathematics
 is its eternal assertions about the world of ideas, and this property should
 be at least highlighted in the classroom as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However not highlighted yet enough, the presence of numerical errors can
 be crucial in many levels of verification.
 These problems can be worked around by using arbitrary precision floating
 point arithmetics, or integer arithmetics, or symbolic computations.
 There are professional software systems (namely, CAS) which provide advanced
 tools (including a programming language) for defining mathematical problems
 and to solve them efficiently (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:Implementation-in-GeoGebra"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:The-candidates"

\end_inset

 for some possible systems).
 On the other hand, to use such tools the user also has to be educated at
 a higher level in both mathematics and computer science to formalize the
 problem precisely enough.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Step 2 (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

discovery
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) and Step 3 (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

verification (testing)
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) are, in fact, technically quite close to each other.
 When discovering new facts in mathematics one needs to verify whether the
 collected information is correct.
 Thus, within certain limits, a DGS tool for automatic discovery will likely
 use lower or higher level verification tools to provide information for
 the student.
 For example, checking the parallelism in the Level 1 example can be a later
 step than trying to discover if there is some kind of relationship between
 the appropriate lines at all.
 Such kind of 
\series bold
relationships
\series default
 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Possible-ways-for"

\end_inset

) can be collected automatically by simply selecting the triangle and some
 (or even all) other objects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This kind of approach can also be fruitful at Step 4 (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

intellectual challenge
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 Even if the computer cannot create a readable or spectacular 
\series bold
proof
\series default
 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Possible-ways-for"

\end_inset

), it can still collect some possibly related facts which may help the student
 to create the rigorous proof.
 For example, to prove 
\begin_inset Index idx

\end_inset

Thales' (circle) theorem (see Example
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 on page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "Thales'-theorem-can"

\end_inset

, i.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

e., if 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 are points on a circle where the line 
\begin_inset Formula $DE$
\end_inset

 is a diameter of the circle, then the angle 
\begin_inset Formula $DBE\angle$
\end_inset

 is a right angle), assuming that 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is the center of the circle it can be an important consideration to draw
 segment 
\begin_inset Formula $AB$
\end_inset

 and remark that 
\begin_inset Formula $AD=AE=AB$
\end_inset

 (which will help to find equal angles, e.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $DAB\angle=ABD\angle$
\end_inset

, and so on).
 A computer can collect such pieces of information without any systematic
 order, which means that these pieces like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle may
 be helpful, but may also be useless if not all pieces are collected or
 the student alone cannot build them up into a rigorous proof.
 (Such an approach is suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Magajna"

\end_inset

.) As a consequence, a computer may help in Step 4, but the final 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

intellectual challenge
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 has to be done by the student more or less alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to highlight that for Step 5 (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

systematization
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) it seems crucial for the student to learn argumentation in a community,
 conducted by a teacher (as discussed on page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "Another-result-in"

\end_inset

).
 Despite this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

human aspect
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, in some sense a computer could still 
\series bold
confirm
\series default
 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Possible-ways-for"

\end_inset

) or disconfirm a formal proof.
 Even so, as discussed earlier, this approach can hardly be an acceptable
 way in secondary education where formal thinking of students is not mature
 enough yet for using rigorous software systems efficiently.
 On the other hand, as one will see later in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Coq"

\end_inset

, using a formal system will lose the elegance (and in most cases, also
 the simplicity) of classic geometry proofs.

In the next section several computer software packages are investigated
 how they support these activities.

\begin_layout Section
Proving with computer support
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Proving-with-computer"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned previously, there are several computer software packages which
 already support proving.
 These are, however, in many cases rather research tools than educational
 software.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section the following tools will be discussed: Cinderella, 
\emph on
GCLC
\emph default
, 
\emph on
GeoProof
\emph default
, Coq, GEX and 
\emph on
JGEX
\emph default
 and GeoGebra 4.4.
 They are freely available for download, and some of them are also open-sourced.
 They will be analyzed according to the collected possible activities in
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Conclusion"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The common example here will be the secondary school theorem 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (see Example
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "parallelogram"

\end_inset

 on page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "parallelogram"

\end_inset

).
 This is simple enough to get a quick overview of each software, but complex
 enough to analyze the possibility of classroom use of the given software.
 Only one example is, of course, too little for evaluation, and in some
 sense our analysis can be considered subjective since the evaluation is
 based not on user statistics.
 Instead, this analysis wants to focus on the available technology, and
 to emphasize the supported activities according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Standard
This theorem will be formulated in the following subsections in different
 ways for the various software packages because of two reasons:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It is important to demonstrate that the same theorem can be written in multiple
 equivalent forms, and this will be natural also for the students (who are,
 of course, not experts of automated theorem proving), so they will simply
 use one suitable interpretation during the classroom time, maybe independently
 from the teacher's hints.
 In fact, an educational software should be prepared for a variety of equivalent
 inputs, and it should handle in the best case 
\emph on
all
\emph default
, but at least 
\emph on
most
\emph default
 of the different interpretations.
 It will be shown in the next subsections that it is a really difficult
 problem to teach the computer to understand many different interpretations
 and convert the human input to processable data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
As such, many software packages are simply not (or not yet) prepared for
 such a diversity.
 Therefore one needs to be careful in the formulation to enter the 
\emph on
expected
\emph default
 input in many cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Free availability of a software package seems to be very important in long
 term educational use.
 Even more, being open sourced is a higher level safety for availability
 for the long term since the missing or erroneous parts of the package can
 be added or updated later by other developers as well.
 On one hand,

As a mathematician, I am deeply convinced that only free programs are acceptable

 I see two main reasons for this:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
A result computed by a “mathematical” system, whose source code is not public,
 can not be accepted as part of a mathematical proof.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Just as a mathematician should be able to build theorems on top of other
 theorems, it should be possible to freely modify and release algorithms
 of mathematical software.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Quotation
[...] Then it is clear too that such software should be diffused in a way which
 is compatible with the requirements of science: public availability, reproducib

a computer assisted mathematical proof can not be performed with a closed-source

 Therefore the relevant timings for comparison with closed-source pieces

that is, it should be considered as a Level 5 verification (see page

 It is very straightforward to create an Euclidean construction without
 knowing any details about the software or reading the documentation by
 using the verbose toolbar.
 This may be important for students.
 On the other hand, defining a segment or a line (by dragging the startpoint
 to the endpoint) may be challenging.
 Also finding proof-related tools are difficult or even impossible for a
 new-comer.

Documentation by

 First, to construct a parallelogram one needs to add three free points
 by using the mouse (
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

), then draw two segments (
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

) by dragging the mouse.
 The next step is drawing two parallel lines (
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

) by dragging the segments to the appropriate point.
 Intersection point of these two lines gives point 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

.
 Now let us define segment 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $AC$

You may wonder how this

 works.
 Cinderella does not use symbolic methods to create a formal proof, but
 a technique called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

randomized theorem checking.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 First the conjecture
\begin_inset Formula $\ldots$
\end_inset

 is generated.
 Then the configuration is moved into many different positions, and for
 each of these it is checked whether the conjecture holds.
 It may sound ridiculous, but generating enough (!) random (!) examples
 in which the theorem holds is at least as convincing as a computer-generated
 symbolic proof.
 Cinderella uses this method over and over to keep its own data structures
 clean and consistent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The applied method is detailed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ulli99"

\end_inset

.
 However this method can be improved to obtain a mathematically strict proof,
 in Cinderella (at least philosophically) this result can be considered
 as a

 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 requires 59 pages described in details by Wu's method (see

 However, for educational use this is still too long, and it requires basic
 analytical computations and the notion of Gröbner basis which is not covered
 by the secondary school curriculum.

GeoProof (

 It supports proving Euclidean geometry theorems by either computing proofs
 algebraically (using Wu's method or the Gröbner basis method) with an internal
 subsytem, or by outsourcing the proof to Coq (by using two possible methods,
 one of them is the area method).

GeoProof has been developed actively until the beginning of 2010's, but
 currently it is no longer maintained due to Narboux's changed approach
 for using a different user interface.
 Narboux, Yves Bertot and Bertot's PhD student Tuan Minh Pham started to
 implement a prototype by using GeoGebra for the user interface instead
 of GeoProof (

 Nevertheless, GeoProof can still be compiled for a modern Linux system

 Surprisingly enough, GeoProof gives the wrong answer here.
 The reason is that the version of GeoProof which was compiled from its
 source code for this dissertation uses the default floating point arithmetic
 which is actually inaccurate for proofs.

 it will be shown that in most cases for statements about triangles it is

 that the

Coq is an interactive theorem prover.
 It allows the expression of mathematical assertions, mechanically checks
 proofs of these assertions, helps to find formal proofs, and extracts a
 certified program from the constructive proof of its formal specification.
 Coq works within the theory of the calculus of inductive constructions,
 a derivative of the calculus of constructions.
 Coq is not an automated theorem prover but includes automatic theorem proving
 tactics and various decision procedures
\begin_inset Formula $\ldots$

Since Coq

 To show the difficulty of this approach, we chose Tarski's axiomatic system

 in Coq.
 The most remarkable feature in Coq is that the teacher can build up an
 own theoretical framework, and then it is possible to particularize the
 theory into lessons.
 The same approach is followed by Tarski and his colleagues (like in many
 mathematical books), and it is completely reflected by the Coq implementation
 by Narboux and Braun.

First we emphasize that Tarski's system, despite being a simple one, is

 This can be easily generalized for more points than two to obtain the appropria

 the downloaded folder (under Linux).
 Now we can simply type the program code from

 a crucial step to use this fact.

The proving process reflects the work of a mathematician.
 Like every kind of work in real life, it consists of different states,
 including the beginning of the work, several intermediate states, and finally
 the end state.
 Inside each step we can check the status of the proof in the top-right
 subwindow inside the Coq IDE.
 The 
\family typewriter
intros
\family default
 command is usually the first step for us to start to work: it simply rewrites
 the goal to a more readable format (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:CoqIDE-3"

\end_inset

): on the top there are the hypotheses 
\emph on
already known
\emph default
, and below them, having a horizontal line above each, the consequences
 (or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

to-dos
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) 
\emph on
to be shown
\emph default
 (here there is only one consequence yet).

\begin_layout Standard
What happened here? We try to find sufficient conditions to prove the only
 subgoal 
\family typewriter
Cong A B A B
\family default
 from the initial status.
 Now if we could use axiom 
\family typewriter
cong_inner_transitivity
\family default
 in the special case 
\begin_inset Formula $C:=A',\, D:=B',\, E:=A',\, F:=B'$
\end_inset

, then the possible truth of 
\family typewriter
Cong A B A' B'
\family default
 (stands for 
\family typewriter
Cong A B C D
\family default
) and 
\family typewriter
Cong A B A' B'
\family default
 (stands for 
\family typewriter
Cong A B E F
\family default
) would imply 
\family typewriter
Cong A' B' A' B'
\family default
 (stands for 
\family typewriter
Cong C D E F
\family default
).
 Coq could automatically use 
\family typewriter
cong_inner_transitivity
\family default
 by recognizing that 
\family typewriter
Cong C D E F
\family default
 should match the pattern 
\family typewriter
Cong A B A B
\family default
, so it will automatically find 
\begin_inset Formula $C:=A,\, D:=B,\, E:=A,\, F:=B$
\end_inset

, but it still requires a hint for some 
\begin_inset Formula $A:=?$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B:=?$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By appending parameters 
\family typewriter
B A
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter
cong_inner_transitivity
\family default
 we give a hint to Coq that the substitution should be 
\begin_inset Formula $A:=B,\, B:=A$
\end_inset

.
 Of course, we can give another hint, for example 
\family typewriter
A A
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
A B
\family default
.
 Later we would see that 
\family typewriter
B A
\family default
 is a good choice, but the others are not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we have two subgoals.
 They are, however, the same, but we can prove each one by one, at least
 for this basic example.
 
\family typewriter
cong_pseudo_reflexivity
\family default
 can help us to continue since it ensures that for all 
\begin_inset Formula $A,\, B$
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter
Cong A B B A
\family default
 holds.
 Now Coq has no other option than to match the pattern from the (first)
 subgoal 
\family typewriter
Cong B A A B
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter
Cong A B B A
\family default
 from the axiom which cannot be other than 
\begin_inset Formula $A:=B,\, B:=A$
\end_inset

.
 That is why Coq here does not require any parameters, but after activating
 the step 
\family typewriter
apply cong_pseudo_reflexivity
\family default
 it simply removes the (first) subgoal since it is no longer a to-do (

This introductory proof will help us to understand the proof for the parallelogr
am theorem which is much more complicated.
 Before continuing it is useful to take a look on the table of contents
 of the monograph to get an overview of the structure of the theory built
 into lessons (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Structure-of-the"

\end_inset

).
 Here we already discussed the library 
\family typewriter
tarski_axioms

 (in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Tarski's-axiomatic-system"

\end_inset

); 
\family typewriter
cong_reflexivity
\family default
 is a part of library 
\family typewriter
cong
\family default
.
 The parallelogram theorem is, fortunately, proven in chapter 7 by using
 various lemmas as prerequisites, mainly from chapters 4 or 6.
 Since the chapters are built on each other, it will be convenient to simply
 use library 
\family typewriter
out_lines
\family default
 which already contains all required lemmas.

Our theorem is numbered as Lemma 7.21 in both the monograph and Coq.
 In fact we need some extra definitions from chapter 7 (for example, the
 notion of midpoint) and also Lemma 7.20 to prove the theorem.
 Thus, to focus on the parallelogram theorem we refer to the Coq code of
 the primary definitions and Lemma 7.20 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:Coq-code-for"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Preliminary-definitions-for"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Definition-for-Lemma"

\end_inset

.
 After loading these commands into the Coq IDE, before starting to prove
 Lemma 7.21 we will see the initial state as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:721-1"

\end_inset

.
 First we can see the definitions including the

assert (Col D B x).

\begin_layout Plain Layout

end{lstlisting}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Here we simply use Lemma 4.13 (see Fig.~

ref{fig:monograph-4})
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

to get two sufficient subgoals {
\backslash
tt Col ?1 ?2 ?3}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

and {
\backslash
tt Cong
\backslash

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Here {
\backslash
tt ?1}, {

tt ?2} and {
\backslash
tt ?3} are some objects, unknown yet,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

but they should match some appropriate objects to continue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Clearly $H_5$ and a suitable {
\backslash
tt Col} hypothesis (here $H_4$ again)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

will fit, thus we proved the assertion and it will be moved
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

to the hypotheses as $H_6$: all proven subgoals can be accepted
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

as hypotheses when they are already proven.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
item
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

To continue, we need to look for the definition of {
\backslash
tt FSC}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

which is the same as definition 4.15 in the monograph
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

(
\backslash
ref{fig:monograph-4}).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
begin{lstlisting}[language=Coq]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

assert (FSC B D P A D B x C).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

unfold FSC.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

unfold Cong_3 in H5.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

spliter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

repeat split; try Cong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Col.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
end{lstlisting}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

The command {
\backslash
tt unfold} will rewrite {
\backslash
tt FSC$
\backslash
ldots$} by using
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

the long definition which is {
\backslash
tt Col B D P $
\backslash
wedge$ Cong
\backslash
_3 B D P D B x
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$
\backslash
wedge$ Cong B A D C $
\backslash
wedge$ Cong D A B C}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

in this case.
 Also hypothesis $H_5$ will be rewritten by using
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

the long definition of {
\backslash
tt Cong
\backslash
_3}.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

The command {
\backslash
tt spliter} then turns $H_5$ (which is a conjunction of
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

three relations) into three different hypotheses (here $H_5$, $H_7$ and
 $H_8$
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

will be the new hypotheses, but just temporarily for this assertion).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Now {
\backslash
tt repeat split; try Cong} will try to rewrite the current (first) subgoal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

by using the long definitions and also resolve such parts of the conjuction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

which can be identified among the hypotheses.
 After this step the subgoal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

is a simple {
\backslash
tt Col B D P} which will be resolved by {
\backslash
tt Col}.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Finally the temporary hypotheses $H_5$, $H_7$ and $H_8$ will be removed
 and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

put back in their original short ``user defined'' form, and also
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

the assertion will be listed as $H_7$.

 Here {

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Our assertion can be changed to the sufficient subgoals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{

 Following the proof
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

in the monograph (

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

which stands for the unicity of line intersection and formalized

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash

\begin_layout Plain Layout

In English this simply means that if there are two intersection points $P,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

segments $AB$ and $CD$ (which have general positions, i.~e.~degenerated
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

positions are excluded), then $P=Q$ must hold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Our assertion and its proof is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

assert (P=x).

\begin_layout Plain Layout

First we {

split the conjunctions to separated hypotheses.
 Then we apply Theorem 6.21

by aligning $A:=A,

\begin_layout Plain Layout

a conjunction of 4 relations.
 $H_{13}$ is a disjunction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

of {
\backslash
tt C = A} and a conjunction, and this latter is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

very similar to the first two elements of the subgoal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

On the other hand, $H_{14}$ and $H_{29}$ are the same as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

the 3rd and the 4th elements of the subgoal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

This is why we will focus on $H_{13}$ and try to remove
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

the first element of the disjunction.
 For this we
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

will assume that $C=A$ and then get a contradiction,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

so we have to remove it from the disjunction and this
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

will prove the subgoal:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

induction H13.

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
end{lstlisting}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Here {
\backslash
tt induction} starts a temporary train of thought
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

by leaving only $C=A$ in $H_{13}$.
 Then $C$ is substituted
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

everywhere in the status list.
 Now we try to find a contradiction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

by adding the subgoal {
\backslash
tt False} with the command {
\backslash
tt apply False
\backslash
_ind}.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

In this temporary system {
\backslash
tt apply H} causes the subgoal to change
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

to {
\backslash
tt Col A B A} (which is the negation of $H$), this simply means
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

if we can prove {
\backslash
tt Col A B A} then it is a sufficient reason
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

to prove the previous subgoal ({
\backslash
tt False}).
 Since {
\backslash
tt Col A B A}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

always holds, we found a contradiction and we can go back
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

to $H_{13}$ to change it to {

\backslash

As shown, the rigorous formal proof of the parallelogram theorem is extraordinar
y complex and difficult (not only for students), and its classroom use is
 contraindicated.
 Despite this, the following educational remarks can be concluded:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Coq implementation of mathematical monographs can be a trustworthy reflection
 of mathematical thinking, and as such, it can be a perfect model of validating
 mathematical proofs.
 However from the educational perspective it is yet inconvenient, technically
 it is possible to define a 
\series bold
per theory framework
\series default
, and also to 
\series bold
confirm
\series default
 if a proof is valid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Euclidean geometry is too complex for formal investigation in the classroom.
 (There are, however, other approaches than Tarski's geometry.
 See 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BertotGuilhotPottier04"

\end_inset

 for another suggestion.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Translating native language reasoning into a language accepted by a computer
 can also be difficult: here we used an arsenal of Coq commands.
 It would be more favorable to allow natural language reasoning, including
 national languages as well.
 Also using speech recognition might be a research topic.
 Combining speech recognition and a DGS on a touchscreen to detect geometrical
 objects precisely, might also help converting human reasoning into a Coq-like
 language.
 At the end, students' argumentation could be verifiable by the computer.
 However, this idea may require several programming challenges, and its
 increment in the education process is still questionable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Despite the validity of the proof in this example will be computed quickly,
 one can ask for more automation (after some more programming) for the expense
 of processing time and other resources.
 This means Coq can find proofs automatically but not always quickly enough.
 For Tarski's system it is theoretically proven that all proofs can be found
 algorithmically, thus only time and memory can limit the success of the
 searching process.
 This is, of course, good news for having a 
\series bold
Level 6 verifier
\series default
, but practically this approach is significantly slower than the other methods,
 and not really useful for non-simple theorems.

A visual illustration of this proof was created in

 One can think of improving the output of GEX for a direct classroom scenario:

When requesting a readable proof, first only Step 1 and its child H are
 shown as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the proof
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 since the arguments in Step 1 may be enough for some students to be convinced.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
On the other hand, some students may require explanation for understanding
 the fact 
\begin_inset Formula $ED=BD$
\end_inset

.
 For them, the computer based tool can unhide Step 2 for the argument 
\begin_inset Formula $CED\triangle\cong AEB\triangle$
\end_inset

.
 If the student is convinced, then no more explanation is needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
However, some students may require even more explanation.
 For them, Step 3 will also be shown with facts 
\begin_inset Formula $CD=AB$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $ECD\angle=EAB\angle$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $CED\angle=AEB\angle$
\end_inset

.
 For some students this granularity of the proof is already acceptable.
 For those who are still not satisfied, the computer can tell that 
\begin_inset Formula $CD=AB$
\end_inset

 is obvious, and on demand it can show explanations of Step 4 and 5.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
And so on, finally, for the most unbeliever students all steps will be unfold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In such a way the granularity of the proof can be fine tuned individually
 by the student.
 Such an approach may be a step forward which also harmonizes with

 the same proof in this case):

 (which is a special detail of the area method theory, namely the

)---in general non-traditional new notions of the area method are more technical
 than visual.
 Not only more explanation is needed to provide a real understanding for
 the proof, but the geometrical meaning is hidden with a semi-algebraic
 derivation.
 In fact by allowing signed quantities with the use of semi-algebraic derivation
s we have a more general system than the algebraic ones, but this generalization
 does not actually ease the reasoning.
 Although it must be acknowledged that the area method can indeed produce
 beautiful (and short) proofs for a wide range of theorems, in this case
 at least the GDD method wins for the educational power.

 The original language of the application is French, but Spanish and Italian
 translations also exist (here the Italian version is shown).
 Géométrix is a DGS having extra features for building up a proof from goals
 (on the top-right) and known facts (on the top-left).
 The student can choose statements from a large set of available relations
 and by using drag-and-drop and mouse click the proof can be built.
 The huge number of possibilities, however, makes theorem proving a difficult
 adventure in Géométrix for the time being: it seems impossible to find
 the path for a correct proof of the parallelogram theorem among the hundreds
 of automatically recognized relations.

In the above I listed several software packages to investigate the current
 state of the art in possible activities in teaching proofs.
 Now I consider some kind of final evaluation if these packages are indeed
 helpful in the classroom use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a 
\series bold
per theory framework
\series default
 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:De-Villiers'-model"

 and

LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Possible-ways-for"

\end_inset

), among the listed systems (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Activities"

\end_inset

), only Coq was proven to be an existing prototype, but in classroom deployment
 it is hardly useful for geometry teaching due to its difficult syntax and
 cumbersome input.
 The main problem here is that rigorosity is implicitly or explicitly exiled
 in the classroom teaching for being simple or just for convenience.
 As

 remarks,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
One of the main defects in the traditional Euclidean proof is its almost
 complete disregard of such notions as the 
\emph on
two sides of a line
\emph default
 and the 
\emph on
interior of an angle
\emph default
.
 Without clariﬁcation of these ideas, absurd consequences result.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But when defining these notions rigorously, as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "visual2"

\end_inset

 point out, one necessarily needs to create a complex reasoning system.
 Thus, in my opinion, a remarkable amount of further work is required on
 both the theoretical side and the implementation to take classroom use
 of such tools into consideration.
 On the other hand, traditional classroom teaching is very well referenced
 in the literature for suggesting various frameworks for different kinds
 of student groups.
 Thus, in my opinion, focus on such a research on the computer support has
 no real function at the moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Experiments
\series default
 are very well supported in various software packages.
 Here my opinion is that the current technology is good enough for the classroom
 use.
 Also many materials are already available as examples for 
\series bold
controlled discovery with questions
\series default
 as learning resources on the Internet, and no particular effort is needed
 for extra implementation support.
 In turn, there are no references about 
\series bold
uncontrolled discovery
\series default
 yet, and it may require further research from the educational point of
 view, both from the mathematical limits and the effect on discovery learning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Today the greatest emphasis should be, not in my opinion only but confirming
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Stylianides12"

\end_inset

 too, on distinguishing 
\series bold
verification
\series default
 and proof.
 A remarkable effort has already been made to create 
\series bold
readable proofs
\series default
 automatically and using them in the classroom directly.
 However, the educational demand is not unequivocal in this question.
 It may probably be more beneficial to focus on developing useful verification
 tools in a DGS than reveal a step-by-step proof 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

too quickly
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It seems also reasonable to extend such a verification tool with at least
 minimal ATP features to make it possible to tell if a statement is indeed
 true 
\emph on
under certain conditions
\emph default
.
 As a final result, a DGS could automatically formalize a valid theorem
 without showing its 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

textbook proof
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also 
\series bold
collecting relationships
\series default
 may be a useful feature in a DGS.
 This can still leave some challenges to the student (at least to ignore
 the unwanted or consider the interesting results of such a search), but
 may also help for those who cannot find correlations easily on their own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Among the listed software packages JGEX is clearly a very good candidate
 to support these educational aims.
 In my opinion, however, it offers too much functionality: for many students
 it may be too complex for using it as an educational tool.
 JGEX is, in addition, a very good example to support multiple ways for
 entering a geometry statement since it has a large set of built-in ATP
 tools in the background for proving.
 This multiplies the various ways of explaining a problem (similarly to
 GeoGebra) which makes the software foolproof.
 On the other hand, I do not find the way easy enough to enter the 
\emph on
thesis of the statement
\emph default
: the hypotheses can indeed be drawn easily, but the thesis must be formulated
 via the menu system by using multiple level of options.
 Here GeoProof can be an example for a simple toolbar.

By focusing on the mass education, I highlight the importance of the KISS
 principle

 here.
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label

\end_inset

 KISS, an abbreviation for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

keep it simple and straightforward
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a design principle to create an education tool as easy to use as it
 is possible (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MarkusPhD,JudithPhD"

\end_inset

).
 In my opinion, GeoGebra is one example for this approach, including its
 simple icons and intuitive tools, the traditional (but minimal) menu system,
 and the internationalization support for 62 languages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, though 
\series bold
confirmation
\series default
 of a student created proof is supported in both Coq and Géométrix, in my
 opinion these methods are not really mature for classroom deployment yet.
 In turn, traditional ways of creating and validating proofs are, in my
 opinion, still important.

Can computer proving replace traditional proving?

 Farmer listed 5 purposes of proving:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
discovery of new logical consequences,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
communication of established logical consequences,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
certification of the truth of logical consequences,

Concerning

replacing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, Farmer means that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
\begin_inset Formula $\ldots$
\end_inset

computer proving in its current form cannot entirely replace traditional
 proving, but computer proving will in time, with suitable advances in mechanize
d mathematics, replace traditional proving just as text editing on a computer
 has replaced typing on a typewriter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To focus on educational aspects, here I highlight Farmer's opinion on the
 current state of computer aided 
\emph on
communication
\emph default
, 
\emph on
learning
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
artistic expression
\emph default
 and the suggested ways of further improvement:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Contemporary formal proofs often do not communicate mathematical ideas as
 effectively as informal proofs, because reasoning is done at too low of
 a level and there are too many uninteresting details.
 What is needed: support for transforming a formal proof into a readily
 understandable exposition of the proof.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Computer proving offers students a way to do proving in an interactive environme
nt with explicit “rules of the game”.
 Computer proving can transform how students learn mathematics by enabling
 them to learn mathematics by doing mathematics.
 What is needed: more promotion of this approach and better interactive
 proving environments for students.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Since computer proving focuses on syntactic manipulation, artist expression
 is much more difficult in computing proving than in traditional proving.
 What is needed: support for making computing proving look more like traditional
 proving.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My conclusions more or less overlap Farmer's beliefs: his 1st and 3rd suggestion
s are about improving readable proofs, and his 2nd ideas support per theory
 frameworks.
