\item Removing (2) since its leading term $a$ is a multiple of leading term $a$ in (1).


\item Removing (3) since its leading term $a$ is a multiple of leading term $a$ in (1).


\item Removing (5) since its leading term $c^{2}$ is a multiple of leading term $c$ in (6).

\end{itemize}
An echelon form of the equation system is:
\begin{align*}
3a+2b+c-5&= 0, &&(1)\\
b-\frac{24}{17}c+\frac{24}{17}&= 0, &&(4)\\
c-\frac{76}{59}&= 0. &&(6)\\
\end{align*}
\begin{itemize}
\item $(1)$ can be reduced by $(4)$ to $3a+\frac{65}{17}c-\frac{133}{17}$
 $\sim a+\frac{65}{51}c-\frac{133}{51}$
$(1')$, equation updated.
\item $(1')$ can be reduced by $(6)$ to $a-\frac{57}{59}$
$(1'')$, equation updated.
\item $(4)$ can be reduced by $(6)$ to $b-\frac{24}{59}$
$(4')$, equation updated.
\end{itemize}
The minimal reduced normed form of the equation system is:
\begin{align*}
a-\frac{57}{59}&= 0, &&(1'')\\
b-\frac{24}{59}&= 0, &&(4')\\
c-\frac{76}{59}&= 0. &&(6)\\
